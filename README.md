# Better Sonic Generations Config Tool
An improved configuration tool for Sonic Generations, using [Sajid's](https://github.com/Sajidur78) decompilation as a base.

This aims to maintain the same design as the original configuration tool, but with some tweaks
in order to improve performance and design inconsistencies.

Fixes so far:
- Aligned text of the Graphics Configuration pane
- Removed repeated title in Graphics Configuration pane
- Added system tray icon
- Changed name of the Antialiasing setting to "Antialiasing (FXAA)"
- Improved resolution list by simplifying the algorithm
- Improved algorithm to set global definition of the analytics option
